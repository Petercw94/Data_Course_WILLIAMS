```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Want to see a cool graphing function?

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```

First, download the dataset:

```{r}
df = read.csv("./mushroom_growth.csv")
head(df, n = 10)
```

Once the data set is loaded in and you want to start testing the relationship between variables to get a feel for the data, you can run the function ggpairs (from the GGallly package):

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpairs(df)
```

How sweet is that?
